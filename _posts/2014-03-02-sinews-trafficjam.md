Next time you’re at a picnic and you discover a procession of ants marching over your meal, wait just a second before you throw your hamburger into the nearest trash can. Take a moment to admire the rapid, purposeful flow of traffic on the ant highway. Pause to appreciate what you don’t see: stopped ants.

下次你去野餐的时候，你把汉堡包扔进最近的垃圾桶，只需稍等秒秒钟，你就会发现一排蚂蚁在你的食物上行进。花点时间欣赏一下在蚂蚁公路上快速而有目的的交通流。停一下，你意识到没看到的东西：不动的蚂蚁。

Now compare this ant highway to an interstate highway through any large American city at rush hour. Whether it’s Route 5 in Seattle or Route 95 outside Washington, DC, the story will be the same—long lines of stopped vehicles.

现在比较一下这条蚂蚁公路到高峰时间的美国城市里的州际公路。无论是在西雅图的5号公路还是华盛顿特区外的95号线，故事都将是同样长的停车路线。

What gives? What do ants know that we don’t know? And more importantly, is there anything we can do to make our highways a little bit more like ant highways?

怎么了？蚂蚁知道什么我们不知道？更重要的是，我们能做些什么使我们的公路更像一条蚂蚁公路？

Those are some of the questions studied by Katsuhiro Nishinari, a self-described “jam-ologist” at the University of Tokyo, who spoke about traffic at this year’s SIAM Annual Meeting in San Diego. “Jam-ology is a very interdisciplinary study,” says Nishinari. “It extends not only to vehicles and ants but also pedestrians, schools of fish in the water, or inventory in a warehouse.”

那些是Katsuhiro Nishinari所研究的问题，一个自称“果酱学家”，在东京大学，他谈到了在今年的暹罗年会在圣地亚哥交通。“干扰技术是一个非常跨学科的研究，”倪世娜日说。它不仅延伸到车辆和蚂蚁，还延伸到行人、鱼群或水中的仓库。

Even the brain has some similarities to a traffic network, as another traffic expert points out. “They are both consensus-like systems with nearly identical equations,” says Sean Brennan of Pennsylvania State University. “I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the 1-dimensional shock-wave behavior of vehicle traffic jams is remarkably similar to the 2-dimensional neural behavior that manifests itself as seizures.”

另一位交通专家指出，即使是大脑与交通网络也有某些相似之处。宾夕法尼亚州立大学的Sean Brennan说：“它们都是类似于等式的系统。”。“我不认为这是一个巧合，车辆交通拥堵的一维冲击波的行为是对二维神经行为非常相似，表现为癫痫发作。”

Traffic engineers, physicists, biologists, and mathematicians have been modeling different kinds of traffic for more than 75 years, and they have come up with a wide variety of mathematical models. And yet, we still don’t have an answer even to some simple questions, such as: Can one person unblock a traffic jam?

交通工程师、物理学家、生物学家和数学家已经模拟了不同种类的交通超过75年，并且他们提出了各种各样的数学模型。然而，我们仍然没有答案，甚至对一些简单的问题，比如：一个人可以疏通交通拥堵？

Let’s get back to those ants. One of the main things that makes them different from humans is a specialized sense of smell. According to Nishinari, their ability to detect pheromones excreted by other ants gives them a way to estimate the density of ants in their immediate vicinity. Unlike humans at rush hour, ants won’t let the density exceed a critical level beyond which the flux of ants would start to decrease. Another thing they won’t do is pass one another. And they always maintain a safe following distance. As a result, they tend to form large platoons that move in a synchronized fashion to their goals. If humans adopted these three simple behaviors, we would be a long way toward curing our traffic woes.

让我们回到那些蚂蚁身上。使他们与人类不同的主要原因之一是嗅觉的特殊性。根据倪世娜日的说法，他们的检测信息素的分泌能力其他蚂蚁的方式让他们估计在其附近的蚂蚁的密度。与人类在高峰时间不同，蚂蚁不会让密度超过临界值，蚂蚁的流量就会开始下降。他们不会做的另一件事是彼此传递。它们总是保持安全的跟随距离。作为一个结果，往往会形成大的排，将以同步的方式达到他们的目标。如果人类采用了这三种简单的行为，我们将很好地解决我们的交通问题。

**Technological Fixes for Selfish Humans**

**对自私人类的技术修正**

Perhaps it’s hopeless to expect humans to behave this way—we’re just too selfish. Moreover, we have no incentive to change. If just one driver chose to obey these rules, it wouldn’t make any difference as long as other drivers continued in their normal selfish ways.

也许指望人类这样做是没有希望的，我们太自私了。此外，我们没有改变的动力。如果只有一个司机选择遵守这些规则，只要其他司机继续他们正常的自私行为，那就没有任何区别了。

But technology can encourage us to behave more altruistically. Metering lights on highway entrance ramps are intended to keep the density of traffic below a critical level. High-occupancy vehicle lanes have the same purpose, along with another, less obvious benefit: They reduce the amount of lane-changing. According to Michael Cassidy, a civil and environmental engineer at the University of California at Berkeley, people often overlook this point. “Even if the special lane is underused, even if it’s only 60% filled, the net benefit to all traffic can be positive. There is less lane changing between the adjacent lanes, and that means less lane changing near the bottlenecks.” 

但技术能让我们表现得更无私。公路入口匝道上的计量灯旨在使交通密度保持在临界水平以下。高占有率的车道有着相同的目的，还有另一个不那么明显的好处：它们减少了车道变换的数量。加州大学伯克利分校土木与环境工程师Michael Cassidy说，人们常常忽略这一点。“即使专用车道使用率，即使只有60%的填充，能对所有流量的净效益。相邻车道之间的车道变化较少，这就意味着在瓶颈附近减少车道改变。

Another technological innovation just starting to show up on the world’s roads is automatic cruise control. Nishinari consulted on the development of a system called CyberNavi (sold by Pioneer Electronics in Japan, but not in the U.S.), that warns drivers when they get within 40 meters of the car ahead. More ambitious systems, already under development in Europe, will enable cars to “talk” to each other and to the infrastructure of the highway. Using wireless communication and GPS devices, cars will tell the highway where they are and what the conditions are around them. In turn, the highway will warn them of traffic jams up ahead, enabling them to slow down in advance. If everybody’s car has the technology, it will keep all the cars spaced far enough apart to give the jam a chance to dissipate. It’s the next best thing to ant pheromones.

另一项刚刚开始在世界道路上出现的技术革新是自动巡航控制。西成咨询系统的发展被称为cybernavi（销售的先锋电子在日本，但不是在美国），警告司机，当他们得到40米以内的车。更雄心勃勃的系统，已经在欧洲的发展，将使汽车“交谈”对方和高速公路的基础设施。使用无线通信和GPS设备，汽车将告诉公路在何处和周围的条件是什么。反过来，公路会警告他们前面的交通堵塞，使他们提前减速。如果每个人的车都有这项技术，它将使所有的车间隔得足够远，让果酱有机会消散。这是蚂蚁信息素的下一个最佳选择。

You don’t have to wait, however, if a retired engineer and amateur scientist named Bill Beaty is right. In 1998, Beaty wrote the following Internet post about an impromptu experiment he had conducted on State Route 520 near Seattle:

你不需要等待，但是，如果一个退休的工程师和业余科学家名叫Bill Beaty是正确的。1998，Beaty写了下面的Internet发布关于即兴实验，他在520国道附近的西雅图进行：

“Rather than repeatedly rushing ahead with everyone else, only to come to a halt, I decided to try to move at the average speed of the traffic. I let a huge gap open up ahead of me, and timed things so I was arriving at the next ‘stop-wave’ just as the last red brakelights were turning off ahead of me.

与其反复地与其他人挤在一起，只是停下来，我决定尝试以平均速度行驶。我让一个巨大的差距，开放在我的前面，和时间的东西，所以我来到了下一个“停止波就像最后的红色的刹车灯被关闭在我的前面。

“Finally I happened to glance at my rearview mirror. There was an interesting sight.

最后我偶然看了一眼后视镜。有一个有趣的景象。

. . . In the neighboring lanes I could see maybe five of the traffic stop-waves. But in the lane behind ME, for miles, TOTALLY UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION. . . . By driving at the average speed of traffic, my car had been ‘eating’ the traffic waves.” [Emphasis present in original.]

. . .在相邻的车道上，我可以看到大约五的交通停止波。但在我身后的车道上，英里，完全均匀分布. . .以平均车速行驶，我的车一直在“吃”交通波。

Because his article was not published in a scientific journal, Beaty’s home-brewed experiment did not attract a lot of attention. Last year, though, Nishinari and three co-authors put “jam-absorption driving” to the test. In a simple computer model of a single-lane road, they confirmed that Beaty’s strategy works. “Slow-in, fast-out” driving, even by one driver, could give an already-formed jam time to dissolve and also prevent the creation of new jams behind the jam-absorbing driver. Beyond that, Nishinari and his colleagues showed (in work not yet published) that the total fuel consumption of all the vehicles on the highway would be decreased by as much as 35%. Thus, one person can make the driving experience more pleasant for everyone and benefit the environment.

因为他的文章不会发表在科学杂志上，Beaty的家酿的实验没有引起太多的关注。Last year, though, Nishinari and three co-authors put “jam-absorption driving” to the test. 在一个简单的单车道的计算机模型，他们证实了Beaty的战略工程。“慢，快出”的驾驶，即使是一个司机，可以给一个已经形成的果酱时间溶解，也防止新的堵塞背后的果酱吸收司机。除此之外，倪世娜日和他的同事发现（未发表的作品），公路上的所有车辆的总燃料消耗量将下降高达35%。因此，一个人可以使驾驶体验更愉快，对每个人和环境有利。

**Jam-absorbing Drivers**

**引起拥堵的司机**

Before you go out and try to drive like Beaty, it’s important to be aware of certain caveats. First, the model Nishinari’s group used was extremely simplistic. The “fast-out” part of the model (which was not part of Beaty’s experiment) was actually instantaneous, which is both physically impossible and extremely unwise. Even if you could accelerate instantaneously, you would run into the car ahead of you unless it was doing the same thing. Also, the model did not take into account the likelihood that the big gap in front of a jam-absorbing driver would encourage drivers from other lanes to cut in front of him.

你去试着开车像Beaty之前，要了解一定的注意事项是很重要的。首先，模型组使用的是非常简单的西成。“快出”的模式的一部分（这是不是Beaty的实验的一部分）实际上是瞬时的，这是不可能的，极其不明智。即使你能瞬间加速，你也会撞上你前面的汽车，除非它在做同样的事情。此外，该模型没有考虑到一个拥挤的司机面前的巨大差距可能会鼓励司机从其他车道在他前面削减。

Other jam-ologists have differing opinions. “The ‘slow into a jam’ strategy is in complete accord with our prior work,” says Brennan. He and his student Kshitij Jerath have work in progress that leads to a similar conclusion, but with a catch. There appear to be “event horizons” such that a car outside the event horizon can eat the jam, although a car inside the event horizon cannot have any effect. Brennan also thinks, based on intuition rather than study, that a gap of more than 5 MPH between your speed and your neighbors’ speeds would lead to more accidents—which certainly would not solve the jam problem.

其他果酱们有不同的看法。布伦南说：“慢进果酱的策略与我们以前的工作完全一致。”。他和他的学生Kshitij Jerath有工作的进展，导致一个类似的结论，但与捕捉。似乎有“事件视界”这样一个在视界外的汽车可以吃果酱，尽管在视界内的汽车不能产生任何效果。布伦南还认为，基于直觉而不是研究，在你的速度和邻居的速度之间超过5英里的差距会导致更多的事故，这当然不能解决拥堵问题。

Cassidy, by contrast, is very skeptical of one car’s ability to affect a traffic jam. “The name of the game should be one thing and one thing only, maximizing discharge rate from your bottleneck,” he says. Because the “slow-in” phase doesn’t affect anything downstream of the bottleneck, he thinks that it cannot address the root of the problem.

相比之下，卡西迪对一辆汽车影响交通堵塞的能力持怀疑态度。“游戏的名称应该是一件事，只有一件事，最大限度地从你的瓶颈放电率，”他说。因为“慢入”阶段不会影响瓶颈的任何下游，他认为它不能解决问题的根源。

Adaptive cruise control (ACC) should, in principle, be even better than manual “jam-absorption,” and it’s based on a similar principle—slowing down long in advance of the “event horizon.” But Brennan and Jerath have shown that a little bit of a good thing can actually turn out badly. They studied a traffic model with two populations of cars. The cars in one group, with a “sensitivity” of 0.3 to the actions of the car in front of them, would correspond to cars not equipped with automatic cruise control. The other group, with a sensitivity of 0.7, would be cars with ACC systems that could detect when the car in front was slowing down, and react accordingly.

自适应巡航控制（ACC），在原则上，要比人工干扰吸收更好，“这是基于类似的原理减缓长在“事件视界前进。”但布伦南和杰拉什表明一点好事可以变坏。他们研究了两辆汽车的交通模型。一组汽车的灵敏度与汽车在他们面前的动作0.3相匹配，这就相当于没有自动巡航控制系统的汽车。另一组的灵敏度为0.7，将是ACC系统的汽车，可以检测前方车辆减速时的反应。

When almost all the vehicles on the road had ACC, Brennan and Jerath showed that the highway could accommodate twice as much traffic before starting to jam. But the increased capacity came with a cost: The flow of traffic became highly vulnerable to the introduction of just a few non-ACC vehicles. If the number of ACC-equipped vehicles decreased from 95% to 90%, for instance, the road’s capacity would decrease significantly. If the density was already close to capacity when the non-ACC vehicles joined the flow, traffic would almost certainly jam. The result suggests that ACC-equipped vehicles should get a separate lane, if and when these systems become popular. But the lane restriction would need to be enforced very strictly.

当几乎所有的车辆在道路上有ACC，布伦南和Jerath发现，公路可容纳两倍的交通开始堵塞。但增加的运力是有代价的：交通流量变得极易受到少数非ACC车辆的引入。例如，如果ACC配备的车辆数量从95%辆减少到90%辆，那么道路的容量将大大减少。如果当非ACC车辆加入车流时，密度已经接近能力，交通几乎肯定会堵塞。结果表明，如果这些系统变得流行，ACC配备的车辆应该有单独的车道。但是，车道限制需要严格执行。

Heterogeneous traffic (made up, say, of vehicles with and without ACC) is a headache not only for traffic but also for traffic modelers. A team led by Saskia Ossen of the Delft University of Technology recently showed that none of the seven leading traffic models predicted the behavior of heterogeneous traffic accurately, when compared to real data extracted from high-speed videos taken from a helicopter. The models include lots of parameters that describe the average behavior of drivers. But a highway where half the vehicles have sensitivity 1 and half have sensitivity 0 will behave very differently from a highway where all the vehicles have sensitivity 0.5. Now imagine a highway with buses, trucks, ACC-equipped vehicles, non-ACC-equipped vehicles . . . Or even worse, go to India, where pedicabs, motorcycles, and elephants are added to the mix.

异构交通（弥补说，车辆有无ACC）是一个头痛的不仅是交通也是交通模型。由代尔夫特科技大学的一个研究小组最近发现，Saskia Ossen的七大交通模型没有预测流量的行为准确，相比实际数据从高速视频从直升机中提取。模型中包含了描述驾驶员平均行为的大量参数。但是一条高速公路，其中一半的车辆有灵敏度1和一半的敏感性0将表现非常不同的公路，所有车辆都有灵敏度0.5。现在设想一个公路，公共汽车，卡车，ACC配备车辆，非ACC配备的车辆。..或更糟的是，去印度，那里的三轮车，摩托车，和大象被添加到混合。

**Investing in Pedestrian Traffic**

**致力于行人往来**

The elephants bring up a final interesting point. Though we usually think of traffic as a problem involving vehicles, some of the least-understood traffic problems involve pedestrians (of the two-legged variety). According to Tobias Kretz, a project manager for Viswalk, a pedestrian simulation developed by PTV in Karlsruhe, Germany, it’s partly a matter of cost. When you build a road, you’ll do a traffic simulation because the relative cost is small. That’s not true when you build a sidewalk. However, pedestrian flow becomes very important during major events like the Olympic Games. PTV has consulted with the organizers of the Vancouver, London, and Rio de Janeiro Olympics to get fans to their desired events faster.

大象带来了最后一个有趣的问题。虽然我们通常认为交通是一个涉及车辆的问题，但一些最不了解的交通问题涉及行人（两条腿的变种）。根据Tobias Kretz，一个viswalk项目经理，通过在卡尔斯鲁厄德国开发区，行人仿真，部分原因是费用问题。当你建造一条道路时，你会做一个交通模拟，因为相对成本很小。这不是真的，当你建立一个人行道。然而，在奥运会这样的大型赛事中，行人流量变得非常重要。PTV与温哥华、伦敦和里约热内卢奥运会的组织者商量，让球迷期望的事件快速。

Because the behavior of pedestrians has been studied much less than that of vehicles, Kretz had to develop his own simulations from the ground up. This year, though, a group of researchers led by Frank Fiedrich of Wuppertal University conducted experiments with 1000 pedestrians to see how they behaved when forced to go around corners or when funneled through a narrow entrance. Kretz looks forward to comparing his models to the group’s field data.

因为行人的行为已经比车辆少多了，Kretz不得不发展自己的模拟，从地上爬起来。不过今年，由伍珀塔尔大学进行的实验有1000个行人看到他们的表现时，不得不转弯或当流经一个狭窄的入口Frank Fiedrich的一组研究人员。克雷茨期待与他的模型组的现场数据。

It may not be obvious, but research on pedestrian traffic is important for automobile traffic, too. According to the Downs–Thompson paradox, travel times in a big city tend to an equilibrium at which all methods of transportation will get you to your destination in the same time. Therefore, the transportation system is only as strong as its weakest link. If societies invest more in road traffic but neglect public transportation or pedestrian traffic, the result may be increased travel times. “We will just blow up the area extent of our cities, implying longer trip length, implying more people choosing the car instead of cycling or walking,” Kretz says. “If we invest in pedestrian traffic, cycle paths, and comfortable walking routes, the spiral will go the other direction.” For this reason, Kretz is skeptical of technological improvements like adaptive cruise control, special lanes, or adaptive speed limits. “I doubt that road jams can be prevented with measures for road traffic only. What we need is innovation in walking, cycling, and public transport.” 

这可能并不明显，但行人交通的研究对汽车交通也很重要。根据《汤普森悖论》，一个大城市的旅行时间趋向于一种平衡，所有的交通方式都能使你同时到达目的地。因此，运输系统只有其最薄弱的环节一样强大。如果社会更多地投资于道路交通而忽视公共交通或行人交通，结果可能是增加了出行时间。“我们会把我们的城市地区的程度，这意味着更长的行程，这意味着更多的人选择汽车而不是骑自行车或步行，”Kretz说。“如果我们投资于行人交通，自行车道，舒适的步行路线，螺旋会走向另一方向。为此，Kretz是持怀疑态度的技术改进，如自适应巡航控制，专用车道，或自适应速度限制。我怀疑只有道路交通措施才能阻止道路交通堵塞。我们需要的是步行、骑自行车和公共交通方面的创新。”

**What’s in a Model?**

**模型中有什么呢？**

The earliest traffic models described traffic as a fluid with no individual cars. Such models are called macroscopic, because they depend only on large-scale variables, such as the average density and velocity of traffic. One valuable insight provided by these models is the fundamental diagram, which conveys the important information that on any road the flux of traffic (i.e., the velocity times the density) increases only up to a certain density, and then it starts to decrease. This is, in a nutshell, why jams occur. 

最早的交通模型把交通描述为没有汽车的流体。这种模型被称为宏观模型，因为它们只依赖于大规模的变量，例如交通的平均密度和速度。这些模型提供的一个有价值的见解是基本图，它传达了重要的信息，即在任何道路上，交通流量（即速度乘以密度）只增加到一定的密度，然后开始下降。简单地说，这就是为什么卡纸发生的原因。

Unfortunately, fluid models have certain undesirable features. They predict that traffic jams should travel in either direction from a bottleneck; in practice, though, jams travel in only one direction: upstream. Fluid models also tend to have a rather unrealistic fundamental diagram. Empirical data show that at high densities, traffic enters a synchronized state in which all the cars travel at almost the same velocity. As soon as a disturbance happens (for example, one driver hits the brakes), the synchrony is broken and the flux drops, creating a “phantom traffic jam,” i.e., one with no visible cause, such as an accident or bottleneck. The very existence of two equilibrium states—one stable and the other metastable—violates a central tenet of the basic fluid models.

不幸的是，流体模型有一些不可取的特性。他们预测，交通拥堵应该从一个方向发展，从一个瓶颈；在实践中，然而，拥堵只在一个方向：上游。流体模型也往往有一个相当不现实的基本图。经验数据表明，在高密度下，交通进入一个同步状态，所有车辆以几乎相同的速度行驶。一旦发生干扰（例如，一个司机踩刹车），同步性就会被打破，流量下降，造成“幻影交通堵塞”，即一个没有明显原因的事故或瓶颈。两个平衡态的存在，一个稳定态和另一个亚稳态违反了基本流体模型的一个中心原理。

In recent years, traffic modelers have turned more toward microscopic models, which simulate every single car. Cellular automaton models are discrete in both time and space, representing the road as a row of cells that cars move into and out of at each time step. The most realistic class of models attempts to describe drivers’ actual behavior—representing the rate at which they accelerate as a function of the headway (distance between cars) or any other variables the modeler deems relevant. These models lead to huge systems of differential equations, either deterministic or stochastic, with as many variables as vehicles on the road. Another drawback of microscopic models is that the difficulty of acquiring experimental data on individual drivers makes all such models somewhat speculative.

近年来，交通建模者日益向微观模型，模拟了每一辆车。元胞自动机模型在时间和空间上都是离散的，代表着道路作为一列细胞在每一个时间段内进出。最现实的模型类试图描述驱动程序的实际行为，这些行为代表了他们加速的速度，作为车头时距（汽车之间的距离）的函数，或者建模者认为相关的任何其他变量。这些模型导致了巨大的微分方程系统，无论是确定性的还是随机的，道路上的车辆有很多变数。微观模型的另一个缺点是，获取单个驾驶员的实验数据的困难使得所有这些模型都有点投机。
