SUPPOSE we had a theory that could explain everything. Not just atoms and quarks but aspects of our everyday lives too. Sound impossible? Perhaps not.

**Spoiler**: It's all part of the recent explosion of work in an area of physics known as random matrix theory. Originally developed more than 50 years ago to describe the energy levels of atomic nuclei, the theory is turning up in everything from inflation rates to the behaviour of solids. So much so that many researchers believe that it points to some kind of deep pattern in nature that we don't yet understand. "It really does feel like the ideas of random matrix theory are somehow buried deep in the heart of nature," says electrical engineer Raj Nadakuditi of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

**拆台**：这是物理学领域最近爆炸性工作的一部分，被称为随机矩阵理论。这个理论最初是在50多年前发展起来的，用来描述原子核的能量水平。以至于许多研究者认为它指的是某种我们尚未理解的深层模式。它真的感觉像随机矩阵理论的思想都埋在大自然的内心深处，”密歇根大学的电气工程师Raj Nadakuditi，安娜堡。

All of this, oddly enough, emerged from an effort to turn physicists' ignorance into an advantage. In 1956, when we knew very little about the internal workings of large, complex atomic nuclei, such as uranium, the German physicist Eugene Wigner suggested simply guessing.

奇怪的是，所有这些都是为了把物理学家的无知变成一种优势而产生的。1956，当我们对原子核等大型复杂原子核的内部运作知之甚少时，德国物理学家Eugene Wigner简单地猜测了一下。

Quantum theory tells us that atomic nuclei have many discrete energy levels, like unevenly spaced rungs on a ladder. To calculate the spacing between each of the rungs, you would need to know the myriad possible ways the nucleus can hop from one to another, and the probabilities for those events to happen. Wigner didn't know, so instead he picked numbers at random for the probabilities and arranged them in a square array called a matrix.

量子理论告诉我们，atomic nuclei有许多分立的能级间隔不均匀，像一部梯子。计算每个梯级之间的间距，你需要知道的无数可能的核可以跳的方式从一个到另一个，和那些事件发生的概率。维格纳不知道，所以他随意挑选概率的数字，把它们排列成一个方阵叫做矩阵。

The matrix was a neat way to express the many connections between the different rungs. It also allowed Wigner to exploit the powerful mathematics of matrices in order to make predictions about the energy levels.

矩阵是一个整洁的方式来表达不同层次之间的许多联系。它还允许维格纳利用矩阵的强大数学，以便对能量水平作出预测。

Bizarrely, he found this simple approach enabled him to work out the likelihood that any one level would have others nearby, in the absence of any real knowledge. Wigner's results, worked out in a few lines of algebra, were far more useful than anyone could have expected, and experiments over the next few years showed a remarkably close fit to his predictions. Why they work, though, remains a mystery even today.

奇怪的是，他发现这个简单的方法使得他的作品，任何一级将附近其他的可能性，在任何真正的知识的缺失。维格纳的研究成果，用几行代数计算出来，远比任何人预期的要有用得多，而且在接下来的几年里的实验显示出与他的预测非常接近的程度。尽管如此，他们为什么工作至今仍是个谜。

What is most remarkable, though, is how Wigner's idea has been used since then. It can be applied to a host of problems involving many interlinked variables whose connections can be represented as a random matrix.

最值得注意的是，从那时起维格纳的思想是如何被使用的。它可以应用于许多涉及许多相互关联的变量的问题，这些变量的连接可以表示为一个随机矩阵。

The first discovery of a link between Wigner's idea and something completely unrelated to nuclear physics came about after a chance meeting in the early 1970s between British physicist Freeman Dyson and American mathematician Hugh Montgomery.

维格纳的思想和一些核物理完全无关的之间关系的第一次发现偶然的相遇在上世纪70年代初英国物理学家戴森和美国数学家Hugh Montgomery在。

Montgomery had been exploring one of the most famous functions in mathematics, the Riemann zeta function, which holds the key to finding prime numbers. These are numbers, like 2, 3, 5 and 7, that are only divisible by themselves and 1. They hold a special place in mathematics because every integer greater than 1 can be built from them.

Montgomery一直在探索数学中最著名的函数之一，即黎曼ζ函数，它是寻找质数的关键。这些数字，如2, 3, 5和7，只能由它们自己和1整除。它们在数学中占有特殊的地位，因为每一个大于1的整数都可以从它们中建立起来。

In 1859, a German mathematician called Bernhard Riemann had conjectured a simple rule about where the zeros of the zeta function should lie. The zeros are closely linked to the distribution of prime numbers.

1859，一位名叫Bernhard Riemann的德国数学家推测了一个关于zeta函数零点的简单规则。零点与素数的分布密切相关。

Mathematicians have never been able to prove Riemann's hypothesis. Montgomery couldn't either, but he had worked out a formula for the likelihood of finding a zero, if you already knew the location of another one nearby. When Montgomery told Dyson of this formula, the physicist immediately recognised it as the very same one that Wigner had devised for nuclear energy levels.

数学家们从未能够证明黎曼的假设。Montgomery也不能，但他已经找到了一个公式来寻找一个零的可能性，如果你已经知道附近的另一个位置。当Montgomery告诉Dyson这个公式，物理学家立即意识到这是非常相同的人，维格纳设计了核能量水平。

To this day, no one knows why prime numbers should have anything to do with Wigner's random matrices, let alone the nuclear energy levels. But the link is unmistakable. Mathematician Andrew Odlyzko of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis has computed the locations of as many as 1023 zeros of the Riemann zeta function and found a near-perfect agreement with random matrix theory.

直到今天，没有人知道为什么质数应该与维格纳的随机矩阵有关，更不用说核能了。但这一联系是明确的。明尼阿波利斯明尼苏达大学的数学家Andrew Odlyzko计算多达1023个零点的黎曼zeta函数的位置发现一个近乎完美的协议与随机矩阵理论。

The strange descriptive power of random matrix theory doesn't stop there. In the last decade, it has proved itself particularly good at describing a wide range of messy physical systems.

随机矩阵理论的奇特描述力并没有就此止步。在过去的十年里，它证明了它特别擅长描述一系列混乱的物理系统。

**Universal law?**

**Spoiler:** Recently, for example, physicist Ferdinand Kuemmeth and colleagues at Harvard University used it to predict the energy levels of electrons in the gold nanoparticles they had constructed.

**拆台**：最近，例如，在哈佛大学的物理学家Ferdinand Kuemmeth和他的同事们用它来预测的能量水平的电子在纳米金他们的构造。

Traditional theories suggest that such energy levels should be influenced by a bewildering range of factors, including the precise shape and size of the nanoparticle and the relative position of the atoms, which is considered to be more or less random. Nevertheless, Kuemmeth's team found that random matrix theory described the measured levels very accurately (arxiv.org/abs/0809.0670).

传统的理论认为，这种能量水平应该受到各种因素的影响，包括纳米颗粒的精确形状和大小以及原子的相对位置，这些原子被认为或多或少是随机的。然而，Kuemmeth的团队发现，随机矩阵理论描述很准确的测量水平（arXiv. org / ABS / 809.0670）。

A team of physicists led by Jack Kuipers of the University of Regensburg in Germany found equally strong agreement in the peculiar behaviour of electrons bouncing around chaotically inside a quantum dot - essentially a tiny box able to trap and hold single quantum particles (Physical Review Letters, vol 104, p 027001).

一个物理学家团队由雷根斯堡大学的Jack Kuipers在德国发现了同样强大的协议在电子的奇特的行为跳跃混乱在量子点-基本上是一个小盒子可以捕获和保持单量子粒子（物理评论快报，vol 104，p 027001）。

The list has grown to incredible proportions, ranging from quantum gravity and quantum chromodynamics to the elastic properties of crystals. "The laws emerging from random matrix theory lay claim to universal validity for almost all quantum systems. This is an amazing fact," says physicist Thomas Guhr of the Lund Institute of Technology in Sweden.

列表中已发展到令人难以置信的地步，从量子引力和量子色动力学晶体的弹性性质。”从随机矩阵理论中产生的规律，对几乎所有的量子系统都具有普遍有效性。这是一个惊人的事实，说：”物理学家Thomas Guhr在瑞典技术学院的隆德。

Random matrix theory has got mathematicians like Percy Deift of New York University imagining that there might be more general patterns there too. "This kind of thinking isn't common in mathematics," he notes. "Mathematicians tend to think that each of their problems has its own special, distinguishing features. But in recent years we have begun to see that problems from diverse areas, often with no discernible connections, all behave in a very similar way."

随机矩阵理论得到了纽约大学的数学家喜欢想象，可能会有更多的一般模式，也有Percy Deift。”这种思维在数学中并不常见，”他说。数学家们往往认为他们的每一个问题都有其独特的特点。但近年来，我们开始发现，来自不同领域的问题，往往没有明显的联系，都表现得非常相似。”

In a paper from 2006, for example, he showed how random matrix theory applies very naturally to the mathematics of certain games of solitaire, to the way buses clump together in cities, and the path traced by molecules bouncing around in a gas, among others.

例如，在2006的一篇论文中，他展示了随机矩阵理论是如何很自然地应用到某些纸牌游戏的数学中，如公交车在城市中聚集的方式，以及分子在气体中弹跳的轨迹等。

The most important question, perhaps, is whether there is some deep theory behind both physics and mathematics that explains why random matrices seem to capture essential truths about reality. "There must be some reason, but we don't yet know what it is," admits Nadakuditi. In the meantime, random matrix theory is already changing how we look at random systems and try to understand their behaviour. It may possibly offer a new tool, for example, in detecting small changes in global climate.

也许最重要的问题是，物理学和数学背后是否有一些深奥的理论解释了为什么随机矩阵似乎捕捉到了关于现实的基本真理。一定是有原因的，但我们还不知道它是什么，”Nadakuditi承认。同时，随机矩阵理论已经改变了我们如何看待随机系统，并试图了解它们的行为。它可能提供了一个新的工具，例如，检测全球气候的微小变化。

Back in 1991, an international scientific collaboration conducted what came to be known as the Heard Island Feasibility Test. Spurred by the idea that the transmission of sound through the world's oceans might provide a sensitive test of rising temperatures, they transmitted a loud humming sound near Heard Island in the Indian Ocean and used an array of sensors around the world to pick it up.

早在1991，国际科学合作就开展了被称为“赫德岛”的可行性试验。由于声音通过世界海洋的传播可能对气温上升提供了一个敏感的测试，他们在印度洋附近听到了一个巨大的嗡嗡声，并在世界各地使用了一系列传感器来接收它。

Repeating the experiment 20 years later could yield valuable information on climate change. But concerns over the detrimental effects of loud sounds on local marine life mean that experiments today have to be carried out with signals that are too weak to be detected by ordinary means. That's where random matrix theory comes in.

20年后重复这个实验可能会产生关于气候变化的宝贵信息。但是，对于声音对当地海洋生物的有害影响的担忧意味着今天的实验必须用微弱的信号来执行，而这些信号是微弱的，无法用普通手段探测到。这就是随机矩阵理论的来源。

Over the past few years, Nadakuditi, working with Alan Edelman and others at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has developed a theory of signal detection based on random matrices. It is specifically attuned to the operation of a large array of sensors deployed globally. "We have found that you can in principle use extremely weak sounds and still hope to detect the signal," says Nadakuditi.

在过去的几年中，Nadakuditi与麻省理工学院的Alan Edelman和其他人的工作，开发了一种基于随机矩阵的信号检测理论。它特别适合于在全球部署的大量传感器的操作。我们发现，你可以用极其微弱的声音和原则仍希望能探测到的信号，”Nadakuditi说。

Others are using random matrix theory to do surprising things, such as enabling light to pass through apparently impenetrable, opaque materials. Last year, physicist Allard Mosk of the University of Twente in the Netherlands and colleagues used it to describe the statistical connections between light that falls on an object and light that is scattered away. For an opaque object that scatters light very well, he notes, these connections can be described by a totally random matrix.

另一些人则使用随机矩阵理论来做令人惊奇的事情，例如使光线穿过明显不可穿透的不透明材料。去年，物理学家Allard Mosk在荷兰的屯特大学和他的同事们用它来描述统计之间的联系，光线落在物体上，光被散射掉。对于一个很好散射光线的不透明物体，他指出，这些连接可以用完全随机矩阵来描述。

What comes up are some strange possibilities not suggested by other analyses. The matrices revealed that there should be what Mosk calls "open channels" - specific kinds of waves that, instead of being reflected, would somehow pass right through the material. Indeed, when Mosk's team shone light with a carefully constructed wavefront through a thick, opaque layer of zinc oxide paint, they saw a sharp increase in the transmission of light.

出现的是一些其他分析没有提出的奇怪可能性。矩阵显示，应该有莫斯克所说的“开放通道”的具体类型的波，而不是被反射，会穿过材料。事实上，当莫斯克的团队光照与精心构造的波前通过厚，氧化锌涂料不透明层，他们看到了一个在光传输急剧增加。

Still, the most dramatic applications of random matrix theory may be yet to come. "Some of the main results have been around for decades," says physicist Jean-Philippe Bouchaud of the École Polytechnique in Paris, France," but they have suddenly become a lot more important with the handling of humungous data sets in so many areas of science."

尽管如此，随机矩阵理论的最引人注目的应用可能还没有到来。”一些主要结果已经几十年了，”说，物理学家Jean Philippe Bouchaud在巴黎的É科尔法国理工学院，但是他们突然变得更加重要在科学等许多领域的数据集的处理。”

In everything from particle physics and astronomy to ecology and economics, collecting and processing enormous volumes of data has become commonplace. An economist may sift through hundreds of data sets looking for something to explain changes in inflation - perhaps oil futures, interest rates or industrial inventories. Businesses such as Amazon.com rely on similar techniques to spot patterns in buyer behaviour and help direct their advertising.

从粒子物理学和天文学到生态学和经济学，收集和处理大量数据已经司空见惯。经济学家可能会筛选出数百个数据集，以寻找能解释通货膨胀变化的东西——也许是石油期货、利率或工业库存。像Amazon.com这样的企业依靠类似的技术来发现购买者的行为模式，并帮助指导他们的广告。

While random matrix theory suggests that this is a promising approach, it also points to hidden dangers. As more and more complex data is collected, the number of variables being studied grows, and the number of apparent correlations between them grows even faster. With enough variables to test, it becomes almost certain that you will detect correlations that look significant, even if they aren't.

虽然随机矩阵理论表明这是一种很有前途的方法，但它也指出了隐藏的危险。随着越来越多的复杂数据被收集，所研究的变量的数量不断增长，它们之间明显的相关性的数量增长得更快。有足够的变量进行测试，几乎可以肯定的是，你会发现看起来很重要的相关性，即使它们不是。

**Curse of dimensionality**

**Spoiler:** Suppose you have many years' worth of figures on a large number of economic indices, including inflation, employment and stock market prices. You look for cause-and-effect relationships between them. Bouchaud and his colleagues have shown that even if these variables are all fluctuating randomly, the largest observed correlation will be large enough to seem significant.

**拆台**：假设你在许多经济指数上有多年的数据，包括通货膨胀、就业和股票市场价格。你要寻找他们之间的因果关系。Bouchaud和他的同事们已经证明，即使这些变量都是随机波动，最大的相关性将大到足以显著。

This is known as the "curse of dimensionality". It means that while a large amount of information makes it easy to study everything, it also makes it easy to find meaningless patterns. That's where the random-matrix approach comes in, to separate what is meaningful from what is nonsense.

这就是所谓的“维数灾难”。这意味着，虽然大量的信息使学习一切都很容易，但它也很容易找到无意义的模式。这就是随机矩阵的方法，把有意义的和不正确的东西分开。

In the late 1960s, Ukrainian mathematicians Vladimir Marcenko and Leonid Pastur derived a fundamental mathematical result describing the key properties of very large, random matrices. Their result allows you to calculate how much correlation between data sets you should expect to find simply by chance. This makes it possible to distinguish truly special cases from chance accidents. The strengths of these correlations are the equivalent of the nuclear energy levels in Wigner's original work.

在20世纪60年代末，数学家Vladimir Marcenko和乌克兰Leonid牧草来源的描述非常大的关键性的一个基本的数学结果，随机矩阵。他们的结果允许你计算你应该期望找到的数据集之间的关联度。这使得区分真正的特殊情况和偶然事故成为可能。这些关联的强度相当于维格纳原著中的核能水平。

Bouchaud's team has now shown how this idea throws doubt on the trustworthiness of many economic predictions, especially those claiming to look many months ahead. Such predictions are, of course, the bread and butter of economic institutions. But can we believe them?

Bouchaud的团队现在已经表明，这一想法投在许多经济预测的可信度表示怀疑，尤其是那些自称看今后的几个月。当然，这样的预测是经济体制的基础。但是我们能相信他们吗？

To find out, Bouchaud and his colleagues looked at how well US inflation rates could be explained by a wide range of economic indicators, such as industrial production, retail sales, consumer and producer confidence, interest rates and oil prices.

发现，Bouchaud和他的同事们如何看待美国的通货膨胀率可以通过广泛的经济指标解释，如工业生产、零售销售、消费者和生产者的信心，利率和石油价格。

Using figures from 1983 to 2005, they first calculated all the possible correlations among the data. They found what seem to be significant results - apparent patterns showing how changes in economic indicators at one moment lead to changes in inflation the next. To the unwary observer, this makes it look as if inflation can be predicted with confidence.

使用从1983到2005的数字，他们首先计算了所有可能的数据相关性。他们发现了什么似乎是很重要的结果——一个明显的模式显示了经济指标的变化如何导致下一次通货膨胀的变化。在粗心的观察者，这使它看起来好像可以有信心地预测通货膨胀。

But when Bouchaud's team applied Marcenko's and Pastur's mathematics, they got a surprise. They found that only a few of these apparent correlations can be considered real, in the sense that they really stood out from what would be expected by chance alone. Their results show that inflation is predictable only one month in advance. Look ahead two months and the mathematics shows no predictability at all. "Adding more data just doesn't lead to more predictability as some economists would hope," says Bouchaud.

但当Bouchaud的团队将Marcenko和牧草的数学，他们得到了一个惊喜。他们发现只有少数这些明显的相关性可以被认为是真实的，从某种意义上说，它们确实与预期的单独存在密切相关。他们的调查结果表明，通货膨胀只有提前一个月才能预料到。展望未来两个月，数学显示没有任何可预测性。添加更多的数据就不会导致更多的可预测性，一些经济学家希望，”Bouchaud说。

In recent years, some economists have begun to express doubts over predictions made from huge volumes of data, but they are in the minority. Most embrace the idea that more measurements mean better predictive abilities. That might be an illusion, and random matrix theory could be the tool to separate what is real and what is not.

近年来，一些经济学家开始对大量数据所作的预测表示怀疑，但他们是少数。大多数人认为更多的测量意味着更好的预测能力。这可能是一种错觉，随机矩阵理论可能是区分真实与不真实的工具。

Wigner might be surprised by how far his idea about nuclear energy levels has come, and the strange directions in which it is going, from universal patterns in physics and mathematics to practical tools in social science. It's clearly not as simplistic as he initially thought.

维格纳可能会惊讶于他关于核能水平的想法有多么遥远，以及它正在走向的奇怪方向，从物理学和数学的普遍模式到社会科学的实用工具。这显然不像他最初想的那样简单。
