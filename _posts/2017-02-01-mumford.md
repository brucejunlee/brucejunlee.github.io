David Mumford(芒福德)，Fields奖得主，早年深耕于代数几何领域，作出卓越贡献。后来，带领学生完全转入计算机视觉相关研究，也作出了很大成就。主要利用统计方法，不同于当时的几何方法(代数几何，微分几何)。主要学生有朱松纯等。

Mumford is well known for his pioneering research in geometry, computer vision, and neurobiology. A former recipient of the Fields Medal, the MacArthur Foundation fellowship and the National Medal of Science, Mumford introduced new mathematical models for computer vision using analysis and differential geometry and developed insights into the nature of computation in the human brain. He is a past member of the editorial board of the SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences and a SIAM Fellow.
