<h1 align = "center">YOUTH</h1>
<h3 align = "right">Samuel Ullman</h3> 

Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of 
rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, a 
quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of 
the deep springs of life. 

Youth means a tempera-mental predominance of courage over timidity, of the 
appetite for adventure over the love of ease. This often exists in a man of 
60 more than a boy of 20. Nobody grows old merely by a number of years. We 
grow old by deserting our ideals. 

Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. 
Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spring back to dust. 

Whether 60 or 16, there is in every human being’s heart the lure of wonder, 
the unfailing childlike appetite of what’s next and the joy of the game of 
living. In the center of your heart and my heart there is a wireless 
station: so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer, courage and 
power from men and from the Infinite, so long are you young. 

When the aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with snows of cynicism 
and the ice of pessimism, then you are grown old, even at 20, but as long as 
your aerials are up, to catch waves of optimism, there is hope you may die 
young at 80.
